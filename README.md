# Unlocking Sales Potential: A Power BI Sales Analytics Project

### Project Overview :

The computer hardware industry is known for its rapid changes and dynamic market conditions. The Sales Director of our business recognizes the need for data-driven decision-making to navigate this ever-evolving landscape. In response to these challenges, I am embarking on a Data Analysis project to build a real-time sales insights dashboard using Power BI.

This repository hosts the resources and the self operable Power BI dashboard that will empower the sales director of Atlique Hardware and the team with actionable insights to make informed decisions.

The project will leverage data analytics to address key business questions, such as:
