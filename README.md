# Unlocking Sales Potential: A Power BI Sales Analytics Project

### Project Overview :

The computer hardware industry is known for its rapid changes and dynamic market conditions. The Sales Director of our business recognizes the need for data-driven decision-making to navigate this ever-evolving landscape. In response to these challenges, I am embarking on a Data Analysis project to build a real-time sales insights dashboard using Power BI.
